# Introduction
___
This is a Udacity Front-end Nanodegree project, part of my Google Scholarship. The idea is to recreate a simple clone of the classic Frogger arcade game.


## Installation

If you would like to install this game on your device you can clone or download this repo. Once you have the project folder all you have to do is launch the `index.html`file in your browser (you can find an option to do so by right-clicking on the file). Enjoy

# Play the game

1. Moving player (left, right, up or down) by using arrow key on the keyboard against any enemy.

2. If player have a collision with an enemy, the player will be back to a default position (at the bottom of game screen).

3. If player reach the top of the game screen without any enemy's collision, the player wins.

## Code
Developed using Vanilla JS and Object Oriented JavaScript.
